Proof-of-concept app created for the [Summer of Tech](http://summeroftech.co.nz) Hackfest 2015.
It lets you select multiple categories from [TradeMe](http://trademe.co.nz) and see a grid of
auctions which updates as you watch. You could be buying a present, but you're not sure whether
to get the person a book, game or movie - just add all those categories and see what turns up!

Built by Team Tradeflow: [Theo](https://github.com/theocarr), [Will](https://github.com/Willhs),

## To build

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), but once you have that it's pretty simple.

Just run `npm install` to install dependencies and `node server.js` to start the server.
You can also run `gulp` for a development server, which will automatically recompile client-side
scripts and stylesheets when they're changed.
